    <h1>Hi, I'm Rachel Yan!</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a Junior at Parsons School of Design, majoring in Communication Design 
      and minoring in Economics. I'm a designer and creative coder, with a love/fear/fascination with technology,
       resulting in an insatiable need to experiment with new techniques and technologies in order to expand my design toolkit. My work 
      is focused on using interactivity in its various forms to create engaging and unique experiences.  
      I love monospaced fonts and cats as well.

    <p><b>  Power On</b> is a online platform designed to help a community solve a hypothetical outage issue in 
        downtown Manhattan, where each building has intermittent <b>water</b> and <b>electricity</b> outages, 
        both scheduled and unscheduled.
    <br><br>    The outages are the main focus of the app, so the daily and weekly display of them are right on the homepage, 
    along with any unscheduled outages that others have reported. The report function is also on the homepage, so users can easily 
    submit their own reports. Additionally, a sorting feature allows users to easily find the outages that are of most concern to them.

    <br><br>    While designing the forum, I initially wanted to include a variety of features, like private messages. However I figured 
    that the point of the platform was about communicating these outages, not anything else, so I held back on those features. 
    Instead, I included a phone number and email option in the profile, so users could find a contact point if they needed to.
